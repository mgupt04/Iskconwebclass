    <div class="aboutdes">
        The term "Hare Krishna", or The Hare Krishna Movement Organization, formally The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), is the orthodox core of Hinduism. It was registered in the West (in New York) in July 1966, but dates back over 5000 years. Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486-1532) popularized the movement all over India. 

The principal scriptures are The Bhagavad-gita (The Song of God), and the Shrimad Bhagavatam (the story of the Personality of Godhead Shri Krishna Bhagavan).

        <h2>Our Principles</h2>
        <p>
            When Prabhupada began the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (in New York City in 1966), he formulated a clear mission statement. Thus the 7 Purposes of ISKCON are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>To systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to society at large and to educate all people in the techniques of spiritual life in order to check the imbalance of values in life and to achieve real unity and peace in the world.</li>
            <li>To propagate a consciousness of Krishna (God), as it is revealed in the great scriptures of India, Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam.</li>
            <li>To bring the members of the Society together with each other and nearer to Krishna, the prime entity, thus developing the idea within the members, and humanity at large, that each soul is part and parcel of the quality of Godhead (Krishna).</li>
            <li>To teach and encourage the sankirtana movement, congregational chanting of the holy name of God, as revealed in the teachings of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</li>
            <li>To erect for the members and for society at large a holy place of transcendental pastimes dedicated to the personality of Krishna.</li>
            <li>To bring the members closer together for the purpose of teaching a simpler, natural way of life.</li>
            <li>With a view towards achieving the aforementioned purposes, to publish and distribute periodicals, magazines, books and other writings.</li>
        </ol>
